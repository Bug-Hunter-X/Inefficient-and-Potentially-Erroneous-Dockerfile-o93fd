This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in Dockerfiles: inefficient base image selection and inadequate handling of dependencies. The original Dockerfile uses a large, generic base image (`ubuntu:latest`),  lacks explicit working directory setting, and has a rudimentary approach to installing Python and its packages. This can lead to significantly larger image sizes, longer build times, and potential runtime errors. The solution provides a more streamlined and robust approach using a smaller, more specific base image, setting a working directory, and employing best practices for dependency management.
